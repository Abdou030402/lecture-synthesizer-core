[S1] Alright, class. Today we're going to explore what a computer is and how it works. Now, let's start with the definition: a computer is a general-purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. (smiles) Think about it - a computer can perform a sequence of tasks without any human intervention. This means that since a sequence of operations can be changed, a computer can solve more than one kind of problem. (emphasizes)

Now, let's take a step back in time. The first use of the word "computer" was recorded in the early days of computing devices. These machines were conceived of in the nineteenth century. (pauses) Can you imagine what it must have been like to envision these powerful tools? (smiles)

As we move forward, we'll delve deeper into the world of computers and explore how they've evolved over time. But for now, let's just appreciate the basics: a computer is a device that can be programmed to solve problems - any kind of problem! (emphasizes) And that's what makes them so powerful.
